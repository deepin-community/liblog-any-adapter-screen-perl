NAME
    Log::Any::Adapter::Screen - Send logs to screen, with colors and some
    other features

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.140 of Log::Any::Adapter::Screen (from
    Perl distribution Log-Any-Adapter-Screen), released on 2018-12-22.

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::Any::Adapter;
     Log::Any::Adapter->set('Screen',
         # min_level => 'debug', # default is 'warning'
         # colors    => { trace => 'bold yellow on_gray', ... }, # customize colors
         # use_color => 1, # force color even when not interactive
         # stderr    => 0, # print to STDOUT instead of the default STDERR
         # formatter => sub { "LOG: $_[1]" }, # default none
     );

DESCRIPTION
    This Log::Any adapter prints log messages to screen (STDERR/STDOUT). The
    messages are colored according to level (unless coloring is turned off).
    It has a few other features: allow passing formatter, allow setting
    level from some environment variables, add prefix/timestamps.

    Parameters:

    *   min_level => STRING

        Set logging level. Default is warning. If LOG_LEVEL environment
        variable is set, it will be used instead. If TRACE environment
        variable is set to true, level will be set to 'trace'. If DEBUG
        environment variable is set to true, level will be set to 'debug'.
        If VERBOSE environment variable is set to true, level will be set to
        'info'.If QUIET environment variable is set to true, level will be
        set to 'error'.

    *   use_color => BOOL

        Whether to use color or not. Default is true only when running
        interactively (-t STDOUT returns true).

    *   colors => HASH

        Customize colors. Hash keys are the logging methods, hash values are
        colors supported by Term::ANSIColor.

        The default colors are:

         method/level                 color
         ------------                 -----
         trace                        yellow
         debug                        (none, terminal default)
         info, notice                 green
         warning                      bold blue
         error                        magenta
         critical, alert, emergency   red

    *   stderr => BOOL

        Whether to print to STDERR, default is true. If set to 0, will print
        to STDOUT instead.

    *   formatter => CODEREF

        Allow formatting message. If defined, message will be passed before
        being colorized. Coderef will be passed:

         ($self, $message)

        and is expected to return the formatted message.

        The default formatter can optionally prefix the message with extra
        stuffs, depending on the content of LOG_PREFIX environment variable,
        such as: elapsed time (e.g. "[0.023ms]") if LOG_PREFIX is "elapsed".

        NOTE: Log::Any 1.00+ now has a proxy object which allows
        formatting/customization of message before it is sent to adapter(s),
        so formatting does not have to be done on a per-adapter basis. As an
        alternative to this attribute, you can also consider using the proxy
        object or the (upcoming?) global proxy object.

    *   default_level => STR (default: warning)

        If no level-setting environment variables are defined, will default
        to this level.

ENVIRONMENT
  NO_COLOR
    If defined, will disable color. Consulted before "COLOR".

  COLOR
    Can be set to 0 to explicitly disable colors. The default is to check
    for "<-t STDOUT">.

  LOG_LEVEL => str
  QUIET => bool
  VERBOSE => bool
  DEBUG => bool
  TRACE => bool
    These environment variables can set the default for "min_level". See
    documentation about "min_level" for more details.

  LOG_PREFIX => str
    The default formatter groks these variables. See documentation about
    "formatter" about more details.

SEE ALSO
    Originally inspired by Log::Log4perl::Appender::ScreenColoredLevel. The
    old name for this adapter is Log::Any::Adapter::ScreenColoredLevel but
    at some point I figure using a shorter name is better for my fingers.
